To markup text in Org, simply surround it with one or more marker characters.
*Bold*, /italic/, and _underline_ are fairly intuitive, and the ability to use
+strikethrough+ is a plus. You can _/*combine*/_ the basic markup in any
order, however ~code~ and =verbatim= need to be the *_~inner-most~_* markers
if they are present since their contents are interpreted =_literally_=.
